# Changelog
**Summary of changes of the command line tool**

## Next up
- **[ FEATURE ]** Add new command `klog switch`, that stops a previously
  ongoing activity (open time range), and starts a new one.
- **[ FEATURE ]** `klog start --resume` now falls back to the previous
  record for determining the last entry summary.

## v6.1
- **[ FEATURE ]** Add new flag `klog start --resume`, which takes over the
  summary of the last entry for the new open-ended entry.

## v6.0
- **[ BREAKING ]** The default location of the klog config folder has moved!
  So far, that folder only contains the bookmark database, so if you don’t
  use bookmarks, you can ignore this change. In order to see or configure the
  location of the klog config folder, please run `klog info config-folder`
  (on the new release). The previous location was `~/.klog` on all systems,
  so you might have to manually move over the contents of that previous folder,
  and potentially adjust your dotfile management (if you have that).
- **[ FEATURE ]** Introduce optional, file-based configuration for general
  preferences such as the preferred date or time format, or default values for
  certain CLI flags. See `klog config` / `klog config --help` to learn more.
- **[ FEATURE ]** Display warning when using `--now` without there being any
  open-ended time range in the data.

## v5.4
- **[ BREAKING ]** For `klog edit`, support if the `$EDITOR` variable
  contains additional flags, e.g. `vi -R` or `subl -w`. (If your editor
  path contains spaces, you now have to wrap it in quotes.)
- **[ BREAKING ]** Simplify logic of `klog pause` command; add `--extend`
  flag for extending a previous pause.
- **[ FIX ]** For `klog pause`, recover correctly after computer had
  been asleep.
- **[ FEATURE ]** For `klog pause`, display current record while pausing.
- **[ FEATURE ]** For `klog tags`, optionally display how many entries
  there are per tag via `--count`.
- **[ FEATURE ]** For `klog json`, provide `--now` flag.
- **[ FEATURE ]** For file manipulation commands (e.g. `klog track`),
  improve automatic detection of style preferences in the file.
- **[ INFO ]** Significantly improve parsing performance for large
  data inputs (i.e., for files with 1000+ records).

## v5.3
- **[ FEATURE ]** Optionally amend `klog print` output with total
  values via the `--with-totals` flag.
- **[ FIX ]** Fix unhandled error edge-case in `klog report` command.

## v5.2
- **[ FEATURE ]** Provide tab completion functionality for bash, zsh
  and fish shell. Run `klog completion` for setup instructions.
- **[ FIX ]** `klog edit` handles when the `$EDITOR` variable contains
   spaces, and it also fails when `$EDITOR` is invalid.

## v5.1
- **[ FEATURE ]** Optionally print out totals as decimal values (in minutes)
  via the `--decimal` flag; e.g. `150` instead of `2h30m`.
- **[ FEATURE ]** Support `--now` on `klog tags` as well.
- **[ FEATURE ]** Allow setting a record summary via the `--summary` flag
  when using `klog create`.

## v5.0
- **[ META ]** Release the klog file format specification into the public domain
  (under the CC0/OWFa dual license).
  Read it here: https://github.com/jotaen/klog/blob/main/Specification.md
- **[ FEATURE ]** Allow tags to (optionally) have values assigned to them,
  e.g. `#ticket=1764` or `#type=work`. The values can be quoted if
  they contain special characters: `#project="22/48.3"`.
- **[ FEATURE / BREAKING ]** Allow hyphens (`-`) to appear in tags, e.g. `#home-office`.
- **[ FEATURE ]** For the `--period` flag, additionally allow filtering
  by quarter (`YYYY-Qq`, e.g. `2022-Q1`) and week (`YYYY-Www`, e.g. `YYYY-W34`).

## v4.0
- **[ FEATURE ]** Allow summaries behind entries to be continued on
  the next line (with increased indentation level), e.g.:
  ```
  2020-01-01
  Both of the following is fine:
      15:00-16:00 This is a very long text, so
          it can be continued on the next line.
      16:00-17:00
          Or, you can just start the entry summary
          on the next line, if you like.
  ```
  The CLI also handles this automatically when it encounters
  line breaks (`\n`), e.g. in the `--summary` flag value.
- **[ FEATURE ]** Add new command `klog pause` that “pauses”
  open-ended time ranges by adding a subsequent pause entry.
- **[ FEATURE ]** Provide rounding option for `klog start` and
  `klog stop`, which rounds times to the nearest multiple of
  5m, 10m, 15m, 30m, or 60m. E.g. for `--round=15m`: `8:03` -> `8:00`.
- **[ FEATURE ]** Add more shortcut filters, e.g. `--this-week`,
  `--last-month`, etc.
- **[ FEATURE ]** Embed the most recent part of the changelog for
  convenience, via `klog --changelog`.
- **[ BREAKING ]** Remove embedded macOS systray widget

## v3.3
- **[ FEATURE ]** Allow times to be `24:00`, e.g. `22:00 - 24:00`.
- **[ FEATURE ]** Add `klog goto` command for opening the file explorer
  at the location of a file or bookmark.
- **[ FEATURE ]** Add `klog bookmark info` command.
- **[ FEATURE ]** When using the manipulation commands (`klog track`, etc.),
  conform to style preferences encountered in the file.
- **[ FEATURE ]** Add `--tomorrow` as shorthand flag for the next day’s date.
- **[ FEATURE ]** Improve warnings (which are shown for potential data problems).
- **[ FIX ]** Fix bug in week-based aggregation of `klog report --aggregate week`.

## v3.2
- **[ BREAKING ]** Don’t allow mixing the indentation style within a
  record. (It might still differ *between* records, though.) For example: if
  the first entry is indented with a tab, then all further entries of that
  particular record have to be indented with a tab as well. In order to check
  that your existing files conform, you can parse all your `.klg` files at once
  via a wildcard lookup, in order to see whether any indentation-related
  errors are reported. On Linux, e.g.: `klog total ~/**/*.klg`.
- **[ FEATURE ]** Allow version check via `klog -v` (in addition
  to `klog --version` or `klog version`)
- **[ FEATURE ]** Embed specification and license in the binary
  (via `klog --spec` and `klog --license`)
- **[ FEATURE ]** Provide binaries for M1 Macs (ARM) for download.
- **[ FIX ]** Fix default sort order of `--sort` flag to be `asc`
- **[ INFO ]** Deprecate the embedded native widget (for MacOS). It will be
  removed in one of the next releases.
