# Install klog

In order to install the downloaded klog binary on your system, copy it
to a location that’s covered by your `$PATH` environment variable, e.g.
`mv klog /usr/local/bin/klog` (might require `sudo`).

In order to not miss any updates you can either subscribe to the release
notifications on [Github](https://github.com/jotaen/klog) (at the top right:
“Watch”→“Custom”→“Releases”), or you occasionally check by running
`klog version`.

For other install options, see [the documentation website](https://klog.jotaen.net/#get-klog).
