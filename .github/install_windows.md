# Install klog

In order to install the downloaded klog binary on your system, copy it
to a location that’s included in your `PATH` environment variable, e.g.
`C:\Windows\System32` (might require admin privileges).

For other install options, see [the documentation website](https://klog.jotaen.net/#get-klog).

## Check for updates

In order to not miss any updates you can either subscribe to the release
notifications on [Github](https://github.com/jotaen/klog) (at the top right:
“Watch” → “Custom” → “Releases”), or you occasionally check by running
`klog version`.
